# CLIF Project Template

This repository provides a recommended structure for CLIF project repositories. The proposed layout promotes consistency, facilitates collaboration, and ensures that all essential components are included in each project. While this structure serves as a guideline, Principal Investigators (PIs) have the flexibility to modify it or add additional directories as needed to suit their project's specific requirements.

## Repository Structure
